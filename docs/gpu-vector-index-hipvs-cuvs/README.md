# hipVS/cuVS GPU vector backend

Status: **Phase 1 implemented and review-gated** on AMD `gfx1100` with ROCm
7.2.4. This directory documents the current integration and its reproducible
validation assets. Historical feasibility experiments remain available in Git
history rather than in the product-facing tree.

## Scope

The backend adds optional hipVS/cuVS acceleration behind seekdb's existing
vector adaptor. It does not replace VSAG globally.

- GPU support is compiled only with `OB_BUILD_CUVS=ON`; the default is `OFF`.
- A dense L2 HNSW/HGRAPH index opts in with `WITH (lib=cuvs)`.
- `lib=vsag` indexes keep their existing CPU behavior.
- Cosine and inner-product metrics are rejected for `lib=cuvs` at DDL time.
- Queries with filters, deletes, stale GPU indexes, or an unavailable GPU can
  fall back to VSAG.
- `dbms_vector.batch_knn` exposes one-call batched GPU ANN for explicit batch
  workloads.

The product integration lives in:

- [`ob_vsag_adaptor.cpp`](../../src/oblib/lib/vector/ob_vsag_adaptor.cpp):
  per-index marking, buffered vectors, CAGRA snapshot construction and search,
  freshness and safety fallback, trace points, and batch entry points.
- [`ob_plugin_vector_index_adaptor.cpp`](../../src/observer/vector_index/ob_plugin_vector_index_adaptor.cpp):
  maps declarative `lib=cuvs` indexes to the adaptor handle.
- [`ob_vector_index_util.cpp`](../../src/observer/vector_index/ob_vector_index_util.cpp):
  validates the L2-only DDL contract.
- [`ob_dbms_vector_mysql.cpp`](../../src/pl/sys_package/ob_dbms_vector_mysql.cpp):
  implements `dbms_vector.batch_knn`.

## Bridge

seekdb links a small C ABI bridge instead of importing hipVS/cuVS C++ types into
the server. The maintained bridge source and build entry point are under
[`tools/hipvs_bridge`](../../tools/hipvs_bridge/):

```bash
tools/hipvs_bridge/build.sh /work/bridge/libseekdb_cuvs_bridge.so
```

The bridge exports:

```text
seekdb_cuvs_build
seekdb_cuvs_search
seekdb_cuvs_free
seekdb_cuvs_cagra_knn
seekdb_cuvs_serialize
seekdb_cuvs_deserialize
```

Build seekdb with the resulting library:

```bash
./build.sh release \
  -DOB_BUILD_CUVS=ON \
  -DOB_BUILD_CUVS_TRACE=OFF \
  -DCUVS_BRIDGE_LIB=/work/bridge/libseekdb_cuvs_bridge.so \
  --make -j64
```

For a CPU-only build, leave the defaults or pass:

```bash
./build.sh release \
  -DOB_BUILD_CUVS=OFF \
  -DOB_BUILD_CUVS_TRACE=OFF \
  --make -j64
```

## SQL usage

Per-index GPU opt-in:

```sql
CREATE TABLE items(
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding VECTOR(128),
  VECTOR INDEX idx_embedding(embedding)
    WITH (distance=l2, type=hnsw, lib=cuvs)
);
```

Explicit batch ANN writes results to a caller-created output table:

```sql
CALL dbms_vector.batch_knn(
  "items",
  "query_vectors",
  10,
  "batch_results"
);
```

See [`examples/batch_knn.sql`](examples/batch_knn.sql) for the table contract.

## Validation

For a build comparison, start the GPU-enabled seekdb binary in an isolated
instance with vector memory configured and `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` enabled.
Run the benchmark on the same machine as the observer:

```bash
python3 docs/gpu-vector-index-hipvs-cuvs/validation/benchmark_hnsw_build.py \
  --port 2881 --rows 50000 --dim 128 --repeats 3
```

On Linux the script discovers the live observer log from the SQL listener
when the benchmark user can inspect the observer's file descriptors.
Pass `--log /path/to/seekdb.log` if discovery is unavailable. By default
each run writes a new `hnsw-build-results-<id>.json` in the working directory.

The script creates a fresh benchmark database and loads identical rows into
each test table before timing `CREATE VECTOR INDEX`. It alternates CPU and GPU
run order and records every DDL duration, the median speedup, and Recall@10
against an exact scan of the unindexed source. It requires a successful GPU
graph build and snapshot in the DDL log before reporting a speedup. Keep other
vector-index builds idle while running it so the log window belongs to the
current test. The generated database remains available for inspection.

The bridge uses CAGRA with graph degree 64, intermediate graph degree 128,
and 20 NN-Descent iterations. To reproduce the tuned comparison with the
validation runner's pinned source revision, pass those parameters explicitly.
The runner builds the bridge, starts an isolated seekdb instance, and writes
`hnsw-build-results.json` to its artifacts directory.

```bash
BENCH_CAGRA_PARAMS=64,128,20 \
  bash docs/gpu-vector-index-hipvs-cuvs/validation/run_radeon_build_benchmark.sh \
    docs/gpu-vector-index-hipvs-cuvs/validation/benchmark_hnsw_build.py \
    --rows 50000 --dim 128 --repeats 3
```

The self-contained GPU smoke runner generates deterministic vectors and ground
truth; it does not use private `/work/datasets` or `/work/bench` assets:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/work/bridge:/opt/hipvs/lib:/opt/rocm/lib \
  docs/gpu-vector-index-hipvs-cuvs/validation/run_gpu_smoke.sh \
    --observer /path/to/trace-build/seekdb \
    --bridge /work/bridge/libseekdb_cuvs_bridge.so \
    --base-dir /tmp/seekdb-cuvs-smoke \
    --port 2981 \
    --render /dev/dri/renderD135 \
    --evidence /tmp/seekdb-cuvs-evidence
```

The runner validates:

- cuVS L2 build/serve and same-process VSAG isolation;
- non-L2 DDL rejection;
- filter, delete, and freshness fallback;
- threshold-triggered CAGRA rebuild;
- one-call `batch_knn`, row cardinality, and recall for Top-10 and Top-100;
- GPU device file descriptors and hidden-GPU fallback;
- bounded observer cleanup and closed ports.

The runner writes a machine-readable `summary.json` into its evidence directory.
Results for a specific candidate belong in that pull request's description or a
validation comment rather than in the source tree.
The no-GPU DDL contract remains covered by
[`vector_index_cuvs_ddl.test`](../../tools/deploy/mysql_test/test_suite/vector_index/t/vector_index_cuvs_ddl.test).

## Current limitations

- Phase 1 supports dense float32 L2 indexes only.
- GPU snapshots persist the CAGRA graph for reload. In-memory delta and
  refreshed GPU indexes may build lazily.
- The explicit batch API rebuilds its CAGRA index per call.
- GPU validation is manual because upstream CI has no compatible GPU runner.
- Multi-GPU, long-duration, and snapshot-reload coverage are out of scope for
  this phase.
